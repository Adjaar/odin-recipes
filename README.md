# odin-recipes

This project is meant to demonstrate my HTML skills as well as skills using GIT. At this
point and time this project will not use CSS or Javascript and will contain the bare
structure of a website. I will host a live version on GitHub.

The assignment is to have a multipage recipe website. There will be a main page for
navigation and then three recipes that you can navigate to.

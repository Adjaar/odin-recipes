    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Arroz a la Valenciana is the Nicaraguan answer to Spain's Paella. It is cooked on a stovetop as opposed to an oven,
        and typically doesn't have any seafood in it. <br>There's a lot of flavour in this dish with the veggies and meat, but 
        don't let the many ingredients fool you. This dish is super easy to make and uses ingredients<br> you probably already have! 
        The exception would be achiote or annato powder, but this is used mainly for colour so don't sweat it if you don't have it. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>1 cup of cooked white rice</li>

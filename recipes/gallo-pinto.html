    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Gallo Pinto, translates to "Painted Rooster", is the national dish of Nicaragua. It is said that Nicaragua runs on gallo pinto and
        it many people eat it every single day.<br> This dish is a great example of Nicaraguan food. Simple, unpretentious
        but no less delicious comfort food. Costa Ricans also make gallo pinto, and also claim <br>it as their national
        dish, however Nicaraguans invented it first, so we are cooking it Nicaragua style today! A couple of tips to make truly
        Nicaraguan gallo <br> pinto is to use day old rice, and also toast the rice before cooking them! It adds a carmelized
        flavour thats just so good! </p>
